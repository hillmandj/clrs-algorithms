## Introduction to Algorithms

This is my gradual walkthrough of Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas Cormen, Charles Leiserson, Ronald Rivest, and Clifford Stein (CLRS).

I've wanted to go through this book for a while, though I'm sure based on sheer size it will take quite sometime! I'm attempting to do my best to go through in order and finishing every set of exercises, but that may change as I choose to prioritize different parts of the book over time. I may also skip various exercises here and there but I will do my best to get back to them at some point.

The ultimate goal of this repository is to help me get more oriented with analyzing algorithms and get introduced to concepts I don't get exposed to in the course of my day to day work. It is not meant to be a comprehensive guide to the book. I expect this project to potentially take years to complete, and I will in some cases use external resources to help solve problems.

Sometimes I'll implement things I find interesting that may or may not be in the actual problem sets of the book. These usually live in a `code` folder within the chapter directories, and will most likely be implemented using Ruby.
