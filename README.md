## Introduction to Algorithms

This is my gradual walkthrough of Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas Cormen, Charles Leiserson, Ronald Rivest, and Clifford Stein (CLRS).

I've wanted to go through this book for a while, though I'm sure based on sheer size it will take quite sometime! :P I'm attempting to do my best to go through in order and finishing every set of exercises, but that may change as I choose to prioritize different parts of the book over time.

In certain cases I sometimes implement things I find interesting that may or may not be in the actual problem sets within the book. These usually live in a `code` folder within the chapter directories, and will most likely be implemented using Ruby.

**Contents:**

- [Chapter 1](#)
- [Chapter 2](#)
