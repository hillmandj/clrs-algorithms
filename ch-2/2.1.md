Pseudocode:

```ruby
0.upto(A.length - 1) do |i|
  return i if A[i] == v
end

nil
```

**Loop Invariant:** At the start of each iteration of the for loop, the subarray `A[0..i]` consists of the elements that have been searched for value `v`.

**Initialization:** *Why is this true prior to the first iteration of the loop?*

This is true because the subarray `A[0]` would only container 1 element

**Maintenance:** *Does the loop invariant hold on subsequent iterations of the loop?*

Yes, because with each iteration, we increment the value of `i` following the check. On the first iteration, we check `A[0]`, on the next we've checked `A[0..1]`, then `A[0..2]`, etc.

**Termination:** *When the loop terminates, what useful information does the variant give us to prove the algorithm is correct?*

The loop can only terminate on two conditions:

1) The proper value was found and we exited the loop early returning its index
2) The value was not found and the loop terminated since we've searched every index

In both cases the loop invariant is helpful, since we'd either have searched for all values, or found the given value.

**2.1-4:**

> Consider the problem of adding two n-bit binary integers, stored in two n-element arrays A and B.
>
> The sum of the two integers should be stored in binary form in an (n+1)-element array C.
>
> State the problem formally and write pseudocode for adding the two integers

**INPUT:** A sequence of characters equal to either 1 or 0 (bits) A={x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>...x<sub>n</sub>} and B={y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>...y<sub>n</sub>}

**OUTPUT:** Array `C` consisting of a sequence of bits that are equal to the numerical sum of A / B

```ruby
carry = 0
n.downto(0) do |i|
  c[i + 1] = (a[i] + b[i] + carry) % 2
  if a[i] + b[i] + carry >= 2
    carry = 1
  else
    carry = 0
  end
end
c[0] = carry
```
