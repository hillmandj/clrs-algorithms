**2.3-1:**

*Using figure 2.4 as a model, illustrate the operation of merge sort on the array A={3, 41, 52, 26, 38, 57, 9, 49}*

The top is the final output, the lowest level is where we start, when the array has already been divided into arrays of a single element

```
[3, 9, 26, 36, 41, 49, 52, 57]
               |
[3, 26, 41, 52], [9, 36, 49, 57]
       |                |
[3, 41], [26, 52]  [38, 57], [9, 49]
   |         |         |       |
[3],[41] [52],[26] [38],[57] [9],[49]

```

**2.3-2:**

*Rewrite the MERGE procedure so that it does not use sentinels, instead stopping once either array L or R has had all its elements copied back to A and then copying
the remainder of the other array back into A*

```
# This is pseudocode that rewrites the merge procedure w/o sentinels.
# A is the subarray. p, q, & r are indicies such that p <= q <= r.

Merge(A, p, q, r)
  n1 = q - p + 1
  n2 = r - q

  for i = 1 to n1
    L[i] = A[p + i - 1]

  for j = 1 to n2
    R[j] = A[q + j]

  while not (L.length == 0 || R.length == 0)
    if L[0] < R[0]
      A[A.length + 1] = L[0]
      L = L[1::]
    else
      A[A.length + 1] = R[0]
      R[1::]

  if L.length == 0
    for i = 1 to R.length
      A[A.length + 1] = R[i]
  else
    for j = 1 to L.length
      A[A.length + 1] = L[j]
```

**2.3-3:**

*Use mathematical induction to show that when n is an exact power of 2, the solution of the recurrence:
T(n) = { 2 if n = 2; 2T(n/2) + n if n = 2^k, for k > 1 }
is T(n) = nlog(n)*
