## Getting Started

This chapter focuses on Sorting Algorithms including Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Merge Sort. It formally introduces the concept of Big O (thetha) notation, and breaks down in great detail how that applies to those algorithms.

It introduces formal concepts regarding the analysis of algorithms, including terms like loop invariant, best case / worst case analysis, and divide and conquer.
