**2.1-4:**

*Consider the problem of adding two n-bit binary integers, stored in two n-element arrays A and B.

The sum of the two integers shoul dbe stored in binary form in an (n+1)-element array C.

State the problem formally and write pseudocode for adding the two integers*

INPUT: A sequence of characters equal to either 1 or 0 (bits) A={x1, x2...xN} and B={y1,y2...yN}
OUTPUT: Array C consisting of a sequence of bits that are equal to the numerical sum of A / B

```ruby
carry = 0
n.downto(0) do |i|
  c[i + 1] = (a[i] + b[i] + carry) % 2
  if a[i] + b[i] + carry >= 2
    carry = 1
  else
    carry = 0
  end
end
c[0] = carry
```
