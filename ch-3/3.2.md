**3.2-1:**

> Show that if f(n) and g(n) are monotonically increasing functions, then so are the functions f(n) + g(n) and f(g(n)), and if f(n) and g(n) are in addition nonnegative, then f(n) * g(n) is monotonically increasing

Monotonically increasing functions essentially just means that if we have a function and two possible inputs `m` and `n` where `m <= n` then `f(m) <= f(n)`. If we were to substitue f(n) and g(n) with functions such as: f(n) = 2x and g(n) = x<sup>2</sup> these would be monotonically increasing nonnegative functions.

Therefore:

- f(n) + g(n) &equals; x<sup>2</sup> + 2x
- f(g(n)) &equals; 2(x<sup>2</sup>)
- f(n) * g(n) &equals; 2x<sup>3</sup>

In all of these cases, if we were to set the value of x to `m` instead of `n` where `m <= n`, the output with `m` would be less than or equal to that of `n`.

The more mathematical way of expressing this is:

f(n) + g(n):

```
f(m) <= f(n) for m <= n
g(m) <= g(n) for m <= n
f(m) + g(m) <= f(n) + g(n) for m <= n
```

f(g(n)):

```
f(g(m)) <= f(g(n)) for m <= n
```

This is true since g(m) <= g(n) since it is given that is monotonically increasing (as is f(n)).

f(n) * g(n):

```
f(m) * g(m) <= f(n) * g(n)
```

**3.2-2:**

> Prove equation (3.16): a<sup>log<sub>b</sub>c</sup> = c<sup>log<sub>b</sub>a</sup>

One of the rules of logarithms presented in the chapter is:

log<sub>b</sub>a = log<sub>c</sub> a / log<sub>c</sub>b.

Based on that rule we can expand both sides of the equation to:

a<sup>log<sub>b</sub>c / log<sub>a</sub>b</sup> = c<sup>1 / log<sub>a</sub>b</sup>

Another rule we learned is:

log<sub>b</sub>a = 1 / log<sub>a</sub>b

This would mean that the right side of the equation would evaluate to:

c<sup>1 / log<sub>a</sub>b</sup> &equals; c<sup>log<sub>b</sub>a</sup>

This proves that the equality holds.

**3.2-3:**

> Prove equation (3.19): log(n!) = &Theta;(n * log(n)). Also prove that n! = &omega;(2<sup>n</sup>) and n! = &omicron;(n<sup>n</sup>)

To solve this problem we apply Stirling's approximation presented earlier in the chapter, and attempt to apply the log function to it.

Using the rules of logarithms we learned in the chapter for the middle value, and just applying &Theta; notation to the left and right values we get:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex==&space;\theta&space;\sqrt{n}&space;&plus;&space;n&space;*&space;\log{\left&space;(&space;\frac{n}{e}&space;\right&space;)}&space;&plus;&space;\log{\left&space;(&space;1&space;&plus;&space;\theta&space;\frac{1}{n}&space;\right&space;)}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?=&space;\theta&space;\sqrt{n}&space;&plus;&space;n&space;*&space;\log{\left&space;(&space;\frac{n}{e}&space;\right&space;)}&space;&plus;&space;\log{\left&space;(&space;1&space;&plus;&space;\theta&space;\frac{1}{n}&space;\right&space;)}" title="= \theta \sqrt{n} + n * \log{\left ( \frac{n}{e} \right )} + \log{\left ( 1 + \theta \frac{1}{n} \right )}" /></a>

We can see that the middle value would fall into &Theta;(n * log(n)), we can discard the other values as lower order terms, since the equation would be dominated by that value.
