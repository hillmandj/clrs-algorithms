**3.1-1:**

Let f(n) and g(n) be asymptotically nonnegative functions. Using the basic definition of Theta Notation, prove that max(f(n), g(n)) = THETA(f(n) + g(n))

THETA(g(n)) represents a set of functions such that there exists positive constants c1, c2, & n0 such that `0 <= c1 * g(n) <= f(n) <= c2 * g(n)` for all n >= n0.

Since f(n) is bound between those two constants, and g(n) times the constants c1 & c2 represents the worst case & best cast run times, if we were to chose the maximum between the two, we'd actually be applying specific values for c1 and c2 that would satisfy the max function:

```
f(n) <= max(f(n), g(n))
g(n) <= max(f(n), g(n))
(f(n) + g(n)) / 2 <= max(f(n), g(n))
0 <= (f(n) + g(n) / 2) <= max(f(n), g(n)) <= f(n) + g(n)
```

In the case above, the constants c1 = 1/2 and c2 = 1

**3.1-2:**

Show that for any real constants a and b, where b > 0: (n + a)<sup>b</sup> = THETA(n<sup>b</sup>)

If we were to take the root of b on each side, we would come to (n + a) = THETA(n). Another interpretation of this is that b is the constant of 1. We can then pick any constant for a such that it satisfies the relationship of `0 <= a * g(n) <= f(n) <= b * g(n)`.

**3.1-3:**

Explain why the statement, "The running time of algorithm A is at leastO(n<sup>2</sup>)" is meaningless

This is because Big O notation represents the upper bound of a function such that `0 <= f(n) <= c1 * g(n)` for all n > n0 -- i.e. there is no information in this statement about the lower bounds of algorithm A.

**3.1-4:**

Is 2<sup>(n+1)</sup> = O(n<sup>2</sup>)? Is 2<sup>(2n)</sup> = O(2<sup>n</sup>)?

The first statement is true. We can assign values c1 => 2 and n0 = 0 such that `0 <= 2<sup>(n+1)</sup> <= c1 * 2<sup>n</sup>`

The second statement is false. 2<sup>2n</sup> is equal to 2<sup>n</sup> * 2<sup>n</sup> =  4<sup>n</sup>. There are no constants c1 and n0 which can satisfy that.

**3.1-5:** Prove Theorem 3.1: For any two function f(n) and g(n), we have f(n) = THETA(g(n)) if and only if f(n) = O(g(n)) and f(n) = OMEGA(g(n))

For f(n) = THETA(g(n)), we expand the definition as we have previously for all values of n greater than n<sub>0</sub>:

`0 <= c1 * g(n) <= f(n) <= c2 * g(n)`

We can then blog in values for the constants to satisfy the Big O and OMEGA notation functions:

Omega: `0 <= c3 * g(n) <= f(n)`
Big O: `0 <= f(n) <= c4 * g(n)`

If we merge the inequalities above, we get: 0 <= c<sub>3</sub> * g(n) <= f(n) <= c<sub>4</sub> * g(n), which is the definition of THETA(f(n)).
