## Chapter 3: Growth of Functions

This chapter delves into the specific mathematical theorems and proofs regarding asymptotic notation. In previous chapters we covered things such as &Omicron; notation and &Theta; notation, both of which represent sets of functions that describe how fast an algorithm can execute based on different amounts and types of input. This chapter introduces additional notation, such as: &Omega; Notation, &omicron; Notation, and &omega; notation, which are used less often but are related to &Omicron; and &Theta; notation and are still important in understanding the various "bounds" of potential runtime an algorithm may have.
