## Chapter 3: Growth of Functions

This chapter delves into the specific mathematical theorems and proofs regarding asymptotic notation. In previous chapters we covered things such as &Omicron; notation and &Theta; notation, both of which represent sets of functions that describe how fast an algorithm can execute based on different amounts and types of input. This chapter introduces additional notation, such as: &Omega; Notation, &omicron; Notation, and &omega; notation, which are used less often but are related to &Omicron; and &Theta; notation and are still important in understanding the various "bounds" of potential runtime an algorithm may have.

This chapter also goes over a series of mathematical concepts including rules of Logarithms, Exponents, Floors & Ceilings, and Fibonacci Numbers. Since it covers a lot of topics relatively quickly I found this chapter to be particularly challenging.

I got particularly interested in the Golden Ratio and how that could be applied to Fibonacci Numbers. I also became interested in how the Golden Ratio is derived (which was not presented in the chapter). Please see [Golden Ratio Proof](https://github.com/hillmandj/clrs-algorithms/blob/master/ch-3/golden-ratio-proof.md) for that.
