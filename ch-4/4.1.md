> What does FIND-MAXIMUM-SUBARRAY return when all elements of `A` are negative?

`FIND-MAXIMUM-SUBARRAY` will return the first two incides of `A` along with the value of `0`. This will occur since `FIND-MAXIMUM-CROSSING-SUBARRAY` will always return `0` when returning both the `left_sum` and the `right_sum`, since when trying to compare values when iterating over each half of the array, the sum of those elements will never be greater than `0` (since we'd be adding negative numbers). Therefore, the initialized values for `left_sum` and `right_sum` would always be returned.

> Write the psuedocode for the brute-force method of solving the maximum subarray problem. Your procedure should run in &Theta;(n<sup>2</sup>) time.

The brute-force approach for this involves calculating every possible pair of buy and sell dates where the buy date is prior to the sell date:

```
BRUTE-FORCE-MAXIMUM-SUBARRAY(A):
  low = 0
  high = 0
  profit = 0

  for j = 0 to A.length - 1:
    i = j
    current_profit = 0

    while i <= A.length - 1:
      current_profit += a[i]

      if current_proft > profit:
        profit = current_profit
        low = j
        high = i

      i += 1

  return [low, high, sum]
```

**4.1-3:**

> Implement both the brute-force method and recursive algorithms for the maximum subarray problem on your own computer. What problem size n<sub>0</sub> gives the crossover point at which the recursive algorithm beats the brute-force algorithm? Then, change the base case of the recursive algorithm to use the brute-force algorithm whenever the problem size is less than n<sub>0</sub>. Does that change the crossover point?

Please see [brute-force maximum subarray](https://github.com/hillmandj/clrs-algorithms/tree/master/ch-4/code/brute_force_maximum_subarray.rb)
 and [recursive maximum subarray](https://github.com/hillmandj/clrs-algorithms/tree/master/ch-4/code/maximum_subarray.rb) for individual implementations, and [combined maximum subarray](https://github.com/hillmandj/clrs-algorithms/tree/master/ch-4/code/combined_maximum_subarray.rb) which toggles between the two based on the crossover point.

On my machine the crossover point (n<sub>0</sub>) at which the recursive algorithm was faster than that of the brute force approach was around 34. When comparing the brute-force approach with the combined approach, the crossover point was at about 16. This means that the combined approach starts becoming faster much earlier than the recursive approach.
